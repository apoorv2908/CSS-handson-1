    <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
        <li>CSS describess how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper or other media.</li>
        <li><span class= "lt">CSS is not neccesary.</span><span class = "bg"> CSS saves a lot of work.</span> it can control layout of multiple webpages.</li>
        <li class = "new">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>CSS can be added to HTML docments in 3 ways:</h3>
     
    <ul>
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements !</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section.</li>
        <li>External - by using lin element to link to an eternal Css file.</li>
        <li>The most commo way to add Css is to keep the styles in external files. However, <span class= "bg">In this tutorial we will use internal and inline styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try to understand.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
    <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
    <p>There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied</p>
